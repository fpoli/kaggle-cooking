What's cooking?
===============

My first try at Kaggle competitions: [What's cooking?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking).

 1. Put `train.json` and `test.json` in `data/`
 2. Run one of the scripts, like `python script/linear_svc.py`
 3. Predictions will be stored in `data/results_*.csv` and `data/hist/results_*.csv`

In the competition `ensemble.py` reached an accuracy of **0.79**, ranking 406 out of 1388 teams (maximum accuracy in the competition: 0.83).
